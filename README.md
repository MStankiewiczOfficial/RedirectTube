## Open YouTube links in FreeTube

RedirectTube is a browser extension that redirects YouTube links to FreeTube. It is available for Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.

## Installation

### Mozilla Firefox

#### Method 1: Firefox Add-ons (recommended)

You can install RedirectTube from the Firefox Add-ons.

[![Get the Add-on](https://extensionworkshop.com/assets/img/documentation/publish/get-the-addon-178x60px.dad84b42.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/redirecttube/)

#### Method 2: Manual Firefox installation

1. Download the latest release of RedirectTube (file that ends with `-signed.xpi`) from the [releases page](https://github.com/MStankiewiczOfficial/RedirectTube/releases/). If you see an alert about installing add-ons from untrusted sources, click "Continue installation" and don’t proceed with the next steps.
2. Open the downloaded file in Firefox.
3. Click "Add" to install the extension.
   And that's it! RedirectTube is now installed in your browser.

#### Method 3: Firefox developer mode

This method is for developers and advanced users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you restart your browser, the extension will be disabled.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node scripts/build.js --browser gecko --no-zip` to generate the Firefox bundle inside `dist/gecko`.
3. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on".
5. Select the `manifest.json` file located in `dist/gecko`.
   The extension is now installed in your browser.

### Chromium-based browsers

The Chromium package supports Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and other Chromium-based browsers.

### Method 1: Chrome Web Store (recommended)
You can install RedirectTube from the Chrome Web Store.

[![Get it on Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/static/docs/webstore/branding/image/206x58-chrome-web-bcb82d15b2486.png)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jpbaggklodpddjcadlebabhiopjkjfjh/)

#### Method 2: Manual Chromium installation via developer mode

> [!NOTE]
> The Chromium build is unsigned and must be reloaded manually whenever you download a new release.

1. Download the latest release archive that ends with `-chromium-unsigned.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/MStankiewiczOfficial/RedirectTube/releases/).
2. Extract the ZIP file to a directory you want to keep (the browser needs to access the extracted files).
3. Open `chrome://extensions` (or the equivalent extensions page in your Chromium browser).
4. Enable **Developer mode**.
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the directory you extracted in step 2.
   The extension will appear in the toolbar once the folder is loaded.

## Local builds

RedirectTube keeps a single shared codebase in `src/browser`. Use the provided helper to prepare browser-specific bundles:

```
node scripts/build.js
```

The script requires Node.js 16.7+ (for `fs.cp`) and the `zip` CLI. It produces unpacked bundles at `dist/chromium` and `dist/gecko`, along with ready-to-distribute archives under `dist/packages`. Useful flags:

- `--browser chromium,gecko` – build only the listed browsers.
- `--no-zip` – skip archive creation if you just need the unpacked directory (handy for temporary installs in Firefox/Chromium).

Once built, load the browser-specific folder from `dist/` via your browser's developer mode, or upload the generated archives wherever you distribute the extension.

## Usage

### Via button

Click the RedirectTube button in the toolbar to open the current YouTube video in FreeTube.
