# Translation Standards for RedirectTube

All translations for RedirectTube are managed via the Codeberg platform: https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/redirecttube

## General Requirements
- Translations must be clear, contextually accurate, and user-friendly.
- Prefer idiomatic translations over literal ones.
- Do not translate brand names, product names, or application names (e.g., FreeTube, YouTube).
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the extension.
- Do not translate technical strings that do not make sense in the target language.
- If in doubt, consult the project author or the community.

## Publication Criteria
- A translation must be at least 85% complete (measured by the number of translated words compared to the original).
- Translations below 85% completion will not be included in the public release of the extension.
- Each translation should be reviewed for linguistic and technical accuracy.

## Translation Maintenance Policy
- Translations that remain below 85% completion for three consecutive versions or for at least one month (whichever is longer) will be removed from the extension. This does not affect their availability on the Codeberg platform.
- Removed translations can be reintroduced once they meet the 85% completion requirement and pass the review process.

## Platform
- All translations must be submitted and managed via the Codeberg platform: https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/redirecttube
- Do not submit translations as files or pull requests; use the Codeberg interface for all contributions.

## Final Notes
- Translations should reflect the spirit of the RedirectTube project and help users of the target language use the extension easily.
- Suggestions and corrections can be submitted via the project's GitHub page or directly on the Codeberg translation platform.
