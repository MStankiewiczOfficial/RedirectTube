## Release Notes

- Added a note to the placeholder indicating that it can be disabled in the extension settings.
- Improved styling of the iframe placeholder.
- Added support for Estonian language.
- Updated translations in all supported languages.
- Unnecessary peaks and permissions have been removed.

> [!NOTE]
> In the next update, the following languages will have to be removed because they do not meet the [translation standards](TRANSLATION-STANDARDS.md), meaning they have not reached 85% of translated strings. These languages are Finnish, French, Indonesian, Latvian, and Italian. Please consider contributing to the translations on [Codeberg](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/redirecttube) if you speak any of these languages and would like to help keep them in the extension.
