# 1.12.3 (26013)
[patch release]

## Release Notes

- Fixed a bug causing the "Give your opinion" button in the popup and options page to open Firefox Add-ons instead of the Chrome Web Store on Chromium-based browsers.

> [!NOTE]
> In the next future update, the following languages will have to be removed because they do not meet the [translation standards](TRANSLATION-STANDARDS.md), meaning they have not reached 85% of translated strings. These languages are Finnish, French, Indonesian, Latvian, and Italian. Please consider contributing to the translations on [Codeberg](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/redirecttube) if you speak any of these languages and would like to help keep them in the extension.

> [!WARNING]
> For Firefox, the `-unsigned.xpi` artifact will most likely not install. Use the signed version (`-signed.xpi`) or download from the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/redirecttube/). For Chromium-based browsers, download the `-chromium-unsigned.zip` and load it unpacked in Developer Mode or download from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jpbaggklodpddjcadlebabhiopjkjfjh/).
